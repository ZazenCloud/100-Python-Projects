# Starting #

This guide uses the last Blog lesson (Day 69) as the project to be deployed

Since the lesson use old resources that are not free anymore (e.g. Heroku)... 
I decided to create this guide, in hope that it can help other students

First, pip install gunicorn and psycopg2 in your environment
"pip install gunicorn"
"pip install psycopg2-binary"

Secondly, add "import os" to your main.py
Then change
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///blog.db'
to an Environment Variable
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")


# Using VS Code #

Suggested extensions:
gitignore

- Open your project folder
- CTRL + SHIFT + G (or go to View -> Source Control) to open Source Control
- "Create Repository"
- CTRL + SHIFT + P (or go to View  -> Command Palette) -> "Add gitignore" -> "Python" -> ENTER
- Open the terminal (CTRL + ` or View -> Terminal)
- Write "pip freeze > requirements.txt" -> ENTER
- On the Source Control tab, press the + sign to add the files to the Staging Area
- "Commit"
- "Publish Branch"
- Connect your GitHub account


# Using Render to deploy #

- Create an account at https://render.com/
- Go to https://dashboard.render.com/new/database
- "Name:" Write a unique name
- "Create Database"
- Wait until it is available
- Copy the "Internal Database URL"
- Paste it on a .txt file (or similar)
- Change "postgres" at the beginning of the string to "postgresql"
- Store it temporarily
- Go to https://dashboard.render.com/select-repo?type=web
- "Connect GitHub"
- "Authorize Render"
- "Install"
- Go to https://dashboard.render.com/select-repo?type=web again
(after installing, it goes back to the dashboard)
- Search for your repository and click "Connect"
- "Name:" Write a unique name
- "Build Command:" pip install -r requirements.txt
- "Start Command:" gunicorn main:app
- "Create Web Service"
- Some pip packages version errors can occur, adjust accordingly
e.g. `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement Werkzeug==2.3.6`
Copy the last one in the error list (2.2.3 in this case)
Go to the requirements.txt and substitute "Werkzeug==2.3.6" to "Werkzeug==2.2.3"
Add, Commit and Sync via VS Code Source Control
Deploy your files again via Render.com
- If all pip packages are installed correctly, this error will occur:
`Error: Either 'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI' or 'SQLALCHEMY_BINDS' must be set.`
- Click on "Environment" in the left menu
- "Add Environment Variable"
- Set "Key" to "DATABASE_URL"
- Set "Value" to your stored Internal Database URL
- Click on "Events" in the left menu
- Wait, Render.com will automatically try to deploy it again
- Done, your link is available at the top, below your GitHub repository
