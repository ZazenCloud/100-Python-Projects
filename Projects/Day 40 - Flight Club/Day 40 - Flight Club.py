# This project is an upgraded version of yesterday's project
# (Day 39 - Flight Deal Finder.py)
# It adds support for new members (via console input), email notification
# and alternatives flights with stopover
# (if direct flights for the destination doesn't exist)

# This project requires a Twilio (SMS service)
# and a TEQUILA API (flight search) account, both have a free tier


# Clone this spreadsheet
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YMK-kYDYwuiGZoawQy7zyDjEIU9u8oggCV4H2M9j7os/edit#gid=0
# Add a new tab and name it "users"
# Create 3 columns ("First Name", "Last Name" and "Email") in the new tab


# Log in into https://sheety.co/ with the same Google account
# that you cloned the spreadsheet

# New Project -> paste the link of your spreadsheet -> Create ->
# API -> Enable GET, POST and PUT for both tabs

# Copy the endpoint and paste it as string value for
# SHEETY_ENDPOINT in the flight_club.py file
